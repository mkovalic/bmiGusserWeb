# BMI-Bucket Web Demo

A single-page web app that predicts a person’s **BMI bucket** (Under-, Normal-, Over-weight, Obesity I–III) from a photo.  
The classifier was fine-tuned on the **Celeb-FBI** dataset, exported to Roboflow, and exposed through a serverless workflow.  
This repo only contains the front-end; all heavy lifting happens on Roboflow’s hosted inference service.
